#Python writing files (.txt, .json, .csv)
#w- if file doesn't exist, it creates ; overwrites the content of the file
    #(any existing data will be removed)
#x - only writes if there is no file Use this mode when you want to ensure
    #that you donâ€™t accidentally overwrite an existing file
#a - append the data Use this mode when you want to add data
#     to an existing file without erasing its content.
